# LED light detection in video

## Motivation
To correct video frame timestamps of a video recorded with a highspeed camera a combination of a button triggered TTL pulse and a flashing LED light was used as anchor points. The idea behind those anchor points is further explained in 'timestamp_correction'. This script is only about finding bright circular objects (also LED is flashing) in a video.
